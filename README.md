# PassHunter
Window program for searching for secret keys (passwords, cryptographic keys, etc.) by analyzing text files. The library version is up to date as of June 1, 2023.

The interface provides the ability to configure search parameters, create a simple password dictionary, and sort the list of found results. Analysis is performed using one of three algorithms: word entropy and the PasswordMeter module, a password dictionary file, and an LSTM neural network.

For more detailed results of the program's operation, please refer to the attached thesis file.
